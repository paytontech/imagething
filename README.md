# imagething
imagething has one purpose: (safely) replace every image on a computer with a different one. the keyword is “safely”. this was made as a harmless prank. imagething doesnt overwrite your files completely, it places them elsewhere and includes a simple image restoration utility (in a web browser, go to localhost:6342/restore). more on safety: imagething does **not** overwrite or replace system files. it only replaces image files in desktop, downloads, documents, pictures, videos, and on Windows, “3D Objects”. it can be easily modified to replace in other directories. **imagething does not currently work on macOS and Linux. support for those platforms is coming extremely soon.** Also, Node isnt really the best or fastest runtime for this. currently, the node version is a proof of concept. soon, it’ll be rewritten in something like GO or RUST.
